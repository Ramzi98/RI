binding
of
acetaldehyde
to
the
active

of
ribonuclease
alterations
in
catalytic
activity
and
effects
of
phosphate
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Ribonuclease
was
reacted
with
[1-13C,1,2-14C]
acetaldehyde
and
sodium
cyanoborohydride
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
0.2
phosphate
After
several
hours
of
incubation
at
degrees
(pH
7.4)
stable
acetaldehyde-RNase
adducts
were
formed
and
the
extent
of
their
formation
was
similar
regardless
of
the
presence
of
phosphate
Although
the
total
amount
of
covalent
binding
was
comparable
in
the
absence
or
presence
of
phosphate
this
active
site
ligand
prevented
the
inhibition
of
enzymatic
activity
seen
in
its
absence
This
protective
action
of
phosphate
diminished
with
progressive
ethylation
of
RNase
indicating
that
the
reversible
association
of
phosphate
with
the
active
site
lysyl
residue
was
overcome
by
the
irreversible
process
of
reductive
ethylation
Modified
RNase
was
analysed
using
13C
proton
decoupled
NMR
spectroscopy
Peaks
arising
from
the
covalent
binding
of
enriched
acetaldehyde
to
free
amino
groups
in
the
absence
of
phosphate
were
as
follows
NH2-terminal
alpha
amino
group
47.3
ppm
bulk
ethylation
at
epsilon
amino
groups
of
nonessential
lysyl
residues
43.0
ppm
and
the
epsilon
amino
group
of
lysine-41
at
the
active
site
47.4
ppm
In
the
spectrum
of
RNase
ethylated
in
the
presence
of
phosphate
the
peak
at
47.4
ppm
was
absent
When
RNase
was
selectively
premethylated
in
the
presence
of
phosphate
to
block
all
but
the
active
site
lysyl
residues
and
then
ethylated
in
its
absence
the
signal
at
43.0
ppm
was
greatly
diminished
and
that
arising
from
the
active
site
lysyl
residue
at
47.4
ppm
was
enhanced
These
results
indicate
that
phosphate
specifically
protected
the
active
site
lysine
from
reaction
with
acetaldehyde
and
that
modification
of
this
lysine
by
acetaldehyde
adduct
formation
resulted
in
inhibition
of
catalytic
activity

Reductions
in
breath
ethanol
readings
in
normal
male
volunteers
following
mouth
rinsing
with
water
at
differing
temperatures
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Blood
ethanol
concentrations
were
measured
sequentially
over
period
of
hours
using
Lion
AE-D2
alcolmeter
in
12
healthy
male
subjects
given
oral
ethanol
0.5
g/kg
body
wt
Readings
were
taken
before
and
after
rinsing
the
mouth
with
water
at
varying
temperatures
Mouth
rinsing
resulted
in
reduction
in
the
alcolmeter
readings
at
all
water
temperatures
tested
The
magnitude
of
the
reduction
was
greater
after
rinsing
with
water
at
lower
temperatures
This
effect
occurs
because
rinsing
cools
the
mouth
and
dilutes
retained
saliva
This
finding
should
be
taken
into
account
whenever
breath
analysis
is
used
to
estimate
blood
ethanol
concentrations
in
experimental
situations

Does
the
blockade
of
opioid
receptors
influence
the
development
of
ethanol
dependence?
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
We
have
tested
whether
the
opioid
antagonists
naloxone
(2
mg/kg)
naltrexone
(2
mg/kg)
and
diprenorphine
(0.2
mg/kg)
and
the
agonist
morphine
(4-8
mg/kg)
given
subcutaneously
(10
min
before
ethanol
for
days)
modify
the
ethanol
withdrawal
syndrome
(audiogenic
seizures)
following
chronic
ethanol
intoxication
in
rats
We
found
that
naloxone
naltrexone
and
diprenorphine
modified
the
ethanol
withdrawal
syndrome
These
findings
do
not
rule
out
the
possibility
of
biochemical
link
between
the
action
of
ethanol
and
opiates
at
the
level
of
opioid
receptors

Drinkwatchers--description

</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
Clinical
examination
and
measurement
of
MCV
and
GGT
were
carried
out
on
124
self-referred
'healthy'
Drinkwatchers
all
of
whom
had
consumed
at
least
80
alcohol/day
for
more
than
years
The
majority
(66.1%)
were
in
social
classes
II
and
III
Sixty-three
subjects
(54.1%)
had
raised
MCV
GGT
or
hepatomegaly
raised
MCV
was
significantly
more
likely
to
occur
in
men
Forty-five
subjects
(36.3%)
had
an
enlarged
liver
of
whom
17
had
normal
MCV
and
GGT
This
study
shows
that
MCV
and
GGT
are
poor
screening
tests
for
excessive
alcohol
consumption
in
'healthy'
subjects
but
if
used
at
all
MCV
appears
to
be
more
sensitive
in
women
and
GGT
in
men
Neither
test
is
an
adequate
substitute
for
careful

Platelet
affinity
for
serotonin
is
increased
in
alcoholics
and
former
alcoholics
biological
marker
for
dependence?
</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
The
kinetics
of
3H
serotonin
platelet
uptake
were
studied
in
alcoholics
and
former
alcoholics
to
see
whether
differences
found
between
alcohol-preferring
and
non-preferring
rats
could
be
reproduced
in
man
Three
groups
of
patients
were
studied
10
dependent
alcoholics
on
admission
for
treatment
10
dependent
alcoholics
after
20
days
of
treatment
former
dependent
alcoholics
abstinent
for
1-11
years
Controls
were
non-alcoholics
matched
for
age
and
sex
The
Km
for
3H
serotonin
uptake
in
platelets
was
lower
in
patients
from
all
three
groups
compared
to
15
controls
This
phenomenon
could
be
congenital
or
induced
by
the
previous
excessive
intake
of
alcohol
We
believe
that
this
increased
platelet
affinity
for
serotonin
in
the
absence
of
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
and/or
depression
could
be
marker
for
alcohol
dependence
enabling
the
therapeutic
effort
to
be
focussed
on
these
patients
